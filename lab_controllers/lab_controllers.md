# Writing Web Controllers with Micronaut

## Introduction
In this lab you will learn how to write a REST API that produces JSON output.

Estimated Lab Time: 10 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab you will:
* How to write POJOs that define your JSON responses
* How to write controller routes that match requests
* How to return responses from the controller

### Prerequisites

## Define a Controller

Micronaut's built-in HTTP server is based on the Netty I/O toolkit in combination with an annotation-based programming model for defining routes with support for emitting and consuming JSON via the Jackson library.

> Note that Micronaut does include optional additional modules that add support for things like [Server-side view rendering with template engines like Thymleaf and Velocity](https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-views/latest/guide/) and [XML responses](https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-jackson-xml/latest/guide/index.html).

The annotation-based programming model should be very familiar to anyone who has used libraries like Spring MVC or JAX-RS (note if you prefer those annotation models it is possible to use [JAX-RS annotations](https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-jaxrs/latest/guide/index.html) and [Spring annotations](https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-spring/latest/guide/) with Micronaut as well).

To get started with an example create a file called `src/main/java/example/micronaut/OwnerController.java` and populate it with the following contents:

    <copy>
    package example.micronaut;

    import io.micronaut.http.annotation.Controller;

    @Controller("/owners")
    public class OwnerController {
        private final OwnerService ownerService;

        public OwnerController(OwnerService ownerService) {
            this.ownerService = ownerService;
        }
    }
    </copy>

As you can see the `OwnerController` defines a constructor that injects the `OwnerService` and the class is annotated with `@Controller` to define the root URI for this controller.

## Specify Routes

To expose an individual route over HTTP you need to define methods annotated with an applicable annotation for each HTTP method you wish to expose. Try adding the following definition:

    <copy>
    @Get("/")
    Collection<Owner> getOwners() {
        return ownerService.getInitialOwners();
    }
    </copy>

You'll also need these imports:

    <copy>
    import io.micronaut.http.annotation.Get;
    import java.util.Collection;
    </copy>

This uses the `io.micronaut.http.annotation.Get` annotation to indicate that HTTP `GET` requests to the root URI under `/owners` should match this method and invoke it. The return type represents the response that will be sent over HTTP which by default is assumed to be JSON.

## Return JSON Responses

As mentioned the default response content type is JSON. However to allow many tasks to be peformed without the use of reflection on a Java object such as JSON serialization/deserialization, validation and so on, Micronaut needs access what is known as a [Bean Introspection](https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/guide/index.html#introspection) which allows reading and writing to Java objects according to the rules defined in the [JavaBean specification](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javabeans-spec.html).

To create a Bean Introspection you can annotate any classes required with [@Introspected](https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/api/io/micronaut/core/annotation/Introspected.html). Modify the `Owner` class you created earlier and add the annotation:

    <copy>
    package example.micronaut;

    import io.micronaut.core.annotation.Introspected;

    @Introspected // <-- add the annotation here
    public class Owner {
        // remaining code
    }
    </copy>

Now let's expose some `Owner` objects over HTTP. To see that in action configure some initial owners by modifying your `src/main/resources/application.yml` file so that two `OwnerConfiguration` beans are created:

    <copy>
    micronaut:
      application:
        name: demo
    owners:
      fred:
        name: Fred
        age: 35
      barney:
        name: Barney
        age: 30
    </copy>

Now run your `Application` class from the IDE (as described in Lab 1) and open up Terminal from the IDE and run `curl` to see your response:

```
curl -i http://localhost:8080/owners
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Thu, 26 Nov 2020 08:27:30 GMT
Content-Type: application/json
content-length: 53
connection: keep-alive

[{"name":"Barney","age":30},{"name":"Fred","age":35}]
```

You may now *proceed to the next lab*.
