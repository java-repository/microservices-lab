# Enabling Management Features in Micronaut

## Introduction
In this lab you will learn how to enable management features in Micronaut, including health checks and metrics.

Estimated Lab Time: 15 minutes

### Objectives

In this lab you will:
* Learn how to configure the Micronaut management module
* Understand how to enable and expose management endpoints
* Define your own health checks

### Prerequisites

- Access to your project instance

## Enabling Management Endpoints

Monitoring and access to application health data is critical in a Microservice architecture. To make this easier, Micronaut features built-in capabilities to manage the health of your application.

To get started, modify your Gradle build by adding the following dependencies to your `build.gradle` file within the `dependencies` block:

    <copy>
    implementation("io.micronaut:micronaut-management")
    </copy>

Or if you are using Maven, add the `swagger-annotations` dependency under `<dependencies>`:

    <copy>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.micronaut</groupId>
        <artifactId>micronaut-management</artifactId>
        <scope>compile</scope>
    </dependency>
    </copy>

Before proceeding you should refresh your project dependencies:

![Project Dialog](../images/dependency-refresh.png)

Now add the following configuration to your `src/main/resources/application.yml` file:

    <copy>
    endpoints:
      all:
        enabled: true
        sensitive: false
      health:
        details-visible: anonymous
    </copy>

Note that Micronaut is very conservative about exposing management endpoints that could leak information and result in a security vulnerability, so the majority of endpoints default to `sensitive: true`.

The above configuration will set all endpoints to not be sensitive and also allow anonymous access to the `/health` endpoint.

In a real world application you would either secure your application with [Micronaut Security](https://micronaut-projects.github.io/micronaut-security/latest/guide/) or set `endpoints.all.port` to a different port that is not exposed over the open web.

Now run your application, then open up terminal and issue a request to `http://localhost:8080/health`:

    curl -i http://localhost:8080/health

The output should look like this:

    HTTP/1.1 200 Ok
    Date: Fri, 27 Nov 2020 11:10:14 GMT
    Content-Type: application/json
    content-length: 508
    connection: keep-alive

    {"name":"demo","status":"UP","details":{"jdbc":{"name":"demo","status":"UP","details":{"jdbc:oracle:thin:@projector29405_high":{"name":"demo","status":"UP","details":{"database":"Oracle","version":"Oracle Database 19c Enterprise Edition Release 19.0.0.0.0 - Production\nVersion 19.5.0.0.0"}}}},"compositeDiscoveryClient()":{"name":"demo","status":"UP"},"diskSpace":{"name":"demo","status":"UP","details":{"total":41645027328,"free":21681156096,"threshold":10485760}},"service":{"name":"demo","status":"UP"}}}

As you can see a HTTP 200 response is returned with a status of `UP` indicated. There are various built-in health checks that monitor disk space and database health.

## Defining Health Checks

You can define additional project-specific [HealthIndicator](https://docs.micronaut.io/latest/api/io/micronaut/management/health/indicator/HealthIndicator.html) to extend the functionality of application health checking.

To try this out add two new methods to the `PetRepository` interface:

    <copy>
    Single<Boolean> existsByHealth(Pet.PetHealth health);

    void updatePet(@Id Long id, Pet.PetHealth health);
    </copy>

You'll also need these imports:

    <copy>
    import io.micronaut.data.annotation.Id;
    import io.reactivex.Single;
    </copy>

The first checks if any `Pet` instances exist that correspond the given `PetHealth` enum. The second allows you to update a `Pet` instance's `PetHealth` by ID, which we will use for testing.

Now create a new file called `src/main/java/example/micronaut/PetHealthIndicator.java` and define a class that implements the `HealthIndicator` interface:

    <copy>
    package example.micronaut;

    import io.micronaut.health.HealthStatus;
    import io.micronaut.management.health.indicator.HealthIndicator;
    import io.micronaut.management.health.indicator.HealthResult;
    import io.reactivex.Flowable;
    import org.reactivestreams.Publisher;

    import javax.inject.Singleton;
    import java.util.Collections;

    @Singleton
    public class PetHealthIndicator implements HealthIndicator {
        private final PetRepository petRepository;

        public PetHealthIndicator(PetRepository petRepository) {
            this.petRepository = petRepository;
        }

        @Override
        public Publisher<HealthResult> getResult() {
            return petRepository.existsByHealth(Pet.PetHealth.REQUIRES_VACCINATION)
                    .flatMapPublisher((petsNeedVaccine) -> {
                        String message = petsNeedVaccine ? "Pets Need Vaccine" : "All Pets Vaccinated";
                        HealthResult result = HealthResult.builder("pets")
                                .status(petsNeedVaccine ? HealthStatus.DOWN : HealthStatus.UP)
                                .details(Collections.singletonMap(
                                        "description", message
                                )).build();
                        return Flowable.just(result);
                    });
        }
    }
    </copy>

The `HealthIndicator` expects a `Publisher` as a result and for the indicator to be implemented in a non-blocking manner. The `existsByHealth` method you defined earlier uses an RxJava `Single` that will automatically execute on the I/O thread pool, and if a `Pet` needs a vaccine a `HealthStatus` of `DOWN` will be returned. Otherwise `UP` will be returned, meaning that an instance of the application becomes unhealthy if any Pet instances require a vaccine.

It's time to write a test! Create a new file called `src/main/test/example/micronaut/PetHealthIndicatorTest.java` and populate it with the following contents:

    <copy>
    package example.micronaut;

    import io.micronaut.http.HttpResponse;
    import io.micronaut.http.HttpStatus;
    import io.micronaut.http.client.HttpClient;
    import io.micronaut.http.client.annotation.Client;
    import io.micronaut.http.client.exceptions.HttpClientResponseException;
    import io.micronaut.test.extensions.junit5.annotation.MicronautTest;
    import org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;
    import javax.inject.Inject;

    import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertEquals;
    import static org.junit.jupiter.api.Assertions.assertThrows;

    @MicronautTest(transactional = false)
    public class PetHealthIndicatorTest {

        @Inject @Client("/")
        HttpClient httpClient;

        @Inject
        PetRepository petRepository;

        @Test
        void testPetHealth() {
            HttpResponse<?> response = httpClient.toBlocking().exchange("/health");
            assertEquals(HttpStatus.OK, response.status());

            Pet pet = petRepository.findByNameAndOwnerName("Hoppy", "Barney");

            petRepository.updatePet(
                    pet.getId(),
                    Pet.PetHealth.REQUIRES_VACCINATION
            );

            response  = assertThrows(HttpClientResponseException.class, () ->
                    httpClient.toBlocking().exchange("/health")
            ).getResponse();
            assertEquals(HttpStatus.SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE, response.status());
        }
    }
    </copy>

There are some important aspects to note about this test:

1. By default `@MicronautTest` will roll back transactions between each test execution to ensure data cleanup occurs. `@MicronautTest(transactional = false)` is used to disable transaction rollback between test executions; without this the update operation would only be visible to the test execution and not to the invoked HTTP server.
2. The Micronaut `HttpClient` is used to check the response status is OK initially
3. Then a `Pet` is updated with the `updatePet` method setting the `PetHealth` to `REQUIRES_VACCINATION`
4. Then `assertThrows` is used to verify that `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` is returned from the `/health` endpoint

## Exposing Prometheus Metrics

Exposing application metrics and data points about the behaviour of your application in a Microservice architecture can be critical to maintaining production systems.

Micronaut has support for the [Micrometer](https://micrometer.io) library for exporting application metrics which supports pluggable meter registries.

To get started modify your Gradle build by adding the following dependency to your `build.gradle` file within the `dependencies` block:

    <copy>
    runtimeOnly("io.micronaut.micrometer:micronaut-micrometer-registry-prometheus")
    </copy>

Or if you are using Maven, add the `micronaut-micrometer-registry-prometheus` dependency under `<dependencies>`:

    <copy>
    <dependency>
        <groupId>io.micronaut.micrometer</groupId>
        <artifactId>micronaut-micrometer-registry-prometheus</artifactId>
        <scope>runtime</scope>
    </dependency>
    </copy>

Before proceeding you should refresh your project dependencies:

![Project Dialog](../images/dependency-refresh.png)

Then add the following configuration to your `application.yml`:

    <copy>
    micronaut:
      metrics:
        enabled: true
        export:
          prometheus:
            enabled: true
    </copy>

To access application metrics in JSON format you can visit: `http://localhost:8080/metrics`

To access application metrics in Prometheus format you can visit: `http://localhost:8080/prometheus`

The latter is the URL you can use to configure Prometheus to scrape metrics from the service with.

You may now *proceed to the next lab*.
