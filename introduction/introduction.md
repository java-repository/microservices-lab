# Introduction

## About this Workshop

This workshop is for Java Developers looking to start building applications with [Micronaut](https://micronaut.io) and [Oracle Cloud](https://www.oracle.com/cloud/) with [Autonomous Database](https://www.oracle.com/autonomous-database/).

The workshop features several labs that walk you through the steps to get going with Micronaut and Oracle Cloud.

The source code with completed example code is [available on Github](https://github.com/java-repository/microservices-workshop).

### About Micronaut

Micronaut is an innovative new server-side Java technology that precomputes your framework infrastructure at compilation time. Micronaut can be combined with GraalVM Native Image to build native applications that use less memory and are smaller and faster because of ahead of time (AOT) compilation technology.

Micronaut also includes a persistence framework called Micronaut Data that precomputes your SQL queries at compilation time, making it a great fit for working with Autonomous Database.
